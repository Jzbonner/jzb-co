# Jarrett.Bonner 
Project Portfolio built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and the [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) Bootstrapper. This site was constructed using build tools such as HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, Babel, and npm. Included in my portfolio are a number of other projects that demonstrate my technical skill set, educational overview and previous employment experience. Please feel free to explore all that I have been working on.
