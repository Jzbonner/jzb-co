# Jarrett.Bonner 
Project Portfolio site built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). This site was constructed using dev tools such as HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, Babel, and npm.  Included in my portfolio are a number of other projects that demonstrate my technical skill set, educational overview and previous employment experience. Please feel free to explore all that I have been working on.
