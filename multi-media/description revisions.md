**Bio Page Revised** [âœ”]: 
Being born and raised in the south, I've spent a majority of my time avoiding cold weather climates. In my spare time, I've completed coursework at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, a Junior and Senior Internship/Fellowship with Cisco Inc., and a contract position with the Microsoft Visual Studio Team to test and develop Visual Studio 2019. Despite my continued contribution to the field, I still find the time to share knowledge on a number of tech topics that interest myself and hopefully others. Don't be afraid to signup below, I post about one article a month but the knowledge should last a lifetime.
